# Catch Bugs
A simple game to control the bird to catch bugs.      
This is a game created with cocos, and it's my C++ course project.      
In this game, you control the bird just by touching the screen or clicking the interface, catching a bug will get 1 score.    
And be aware the trees, colliding the trees will end the game.     
The final score only depends on the bugs you catch.      
  It's created with cocos, so there're many version, and I just use the Mac version displayed on desktop.
